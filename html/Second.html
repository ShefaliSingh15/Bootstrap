                 The state of Uttar Pradesh has been receiving continuous rains of varied intensity. The Western and Central parts of Uttar Pradesh have received light to moderate rains with one or two heavy spells during last 24 hours. Scattered rains also occurred over East Uttar Pradesh.<br/>
                 The cyclonic circulation which is over North Chhattisgarh will move in the northwest direction towards Central Madhya Pradesh. Therefore good rains will continue over many parts of Uttar Pradesh.<br/>
                 Places like Kanpur, Hardoi, Lucknow, Bahraich, and Fursatganj, Bareilly may receive moderate rain spells. One or two places may also receive heavy rainy spells. Rains over Varanasi, Allahabad, and Gorakhpur will be light in intensity.

                 <p>
                 Chennai rains have not been disappointing for the residents of the capital city during the month of August. Almost ten days have passed by and the city has been receiving rains of light to moderate intensity. In fact, isolated heavy rainy spells were also witnessed during this period.<br/><br/>
                 However, during the last 24 hours, rainfall activity remained almost absent from the region. In fact, instead of the coastal areas, the interior parts of Tamil Nadu did record a few good spells of rainfall during the last 24 hours. Not only this, a city or two even recorded a whopping three-digit rainfall as well.
